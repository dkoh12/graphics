# OTHER
The arm is made up of 4 cones. The goal is the sphere at the tip of the furthest cone. When the goal is further out than the length of the arm, the arm slightly jitters. 

In main.cpp there are 2 arms. One is commented out and the other is not. When one arm spins, it spins around in a circle and goes around a more 2D motion. When you comment that out and uncomment the other arm that arm goes in a more 3D motion. The difference is that the second parameter inside Link for one of the arms is 0 whereas the other Link has a floating point number. The 2nd parameter tells the amount of rotation for that link.
